# 🐒 Monkeys on Keyboard

**Monkeys on Keyboard** is a collaborative coding tool designed for *vibe coders* who want to co-create applications — especially for teams in **AEC (Architecture, Engineering, Construction)** working together to design buildings in a more open, playful, and iterative way.

## 🚀 What Is It?

It's not just a dev tool — it's a **creative playground** for coders, designers, and engineers to build AEC-focused apps *together*, live. Think of it like a jam session, but instead of music, you're building tools for buildings.

### Key Features

- 🛠️ Real-time collaborative coding
- 🎨 Built-in UI components for AEC workflows
- 🔄 Live preview of your app as you build
- 🐵 Chaos-friendly, creativity-first interface
- 🤝 Open source & community-driven

## 🎯 Who It's For

- Architects who code
- Engineers who prototype
- Designers who think in systems
- Anyone building tools for the built environment with *vibes first, structure later*

## 📦 Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/monkeys-on-keyboard.git
