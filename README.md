# üêí Monkeys on Keyboards

**Monkeys on Keyboards** is a collaborative 3D interactive canvas with AI-powered image generation, designed for *vibe coders* who want to co-create applications ‚Äî especially for teams in **AEC (Architecture, Engineering, Construction)** working together to design buildings in a more open, playful, and iterative way.

Built with React Three Fiber and FAL AI, it's not just a dev tool ‚Äî it's a **creative playground** for coders, designers, and engineers to build AEC-focused apps *together*, live. Think of it like a jam session, but instead of music, you're building tools for buildings.

## üöÄ Key Features

### 3D Interactive Canvas
- **Interactive 3D scene** with various geometric objects and controls
- **Multiple 3D objects**: Box, Cone, Sphere, Cylinder, Torus
- **Transform controls** with move, rotate, and scale modes (keyboard shortcuts: G, R, S)
- **Real-time object manipulation** with visual transform gizmos
- **Clickable objects** with selection and interaction system

### Advanced Scene Elements
- **Fibonacci Scene**: Mathematical art with golden spiral visualization and koala-shaped objects
- **Art Piece Generator**: Click-to-create random shapes (cubes, cylinders, spheres) with random colors and rotations
- **Blue Koala Structure**: Guggenheim-inspired architectural visualization
- **Matrix Cube Instances**: Grid-based cube arrangements with customizable patterns
- **Snake Game**: Interactive 3D snake game within the canvas
- **Terrain System**: Satellite-textured terrain with procedural 3D trees
