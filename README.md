# üêí Monkeys on Keyboards

**Monkeys on Keyboards** is a collaborative 3D interactive canvas with AI-powered image generation, designed for *vibe coders* who want to co-create applications ‚Äî especially for teams in **AEC (Architecture, Engineering, Construction)** working together to design buildings in a more open, playful, and iterative way.

Built with React Three Fiber and FAL AI, it's not just a dev tool ‚Äî it's a **creative playground** for coders, designers, and engineers to build AEC-focused apps *together*, live. Think of it like a jam session, but instead of music, you're building tools for buildings.
