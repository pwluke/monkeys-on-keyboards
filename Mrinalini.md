# 🐒 Monkeys on Keyboard  

**Monkeys on Keyboard** is a collaborative coding tool for *vibe coders* in the **AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction)** space.  
The goal: create an app together that helps teams **design buildings** in a playful, experimental, and community-driven way.

## 🚀 What is this?  
- A sandbox for **AEC innovators** to test ideas quickly.  
- A lightweight framework for **real-time collaboration**.  
- A space where **design + code + vibes** meet to shape building workflows.  

---

## ✨ Features (in progress)  
- 🧩 Modular components for building design logic.  
- 🎨 Visualization hooks for geometry and data.  
- 🤝 Multi-user coding sessions with live sync.  
- 🏗️ AEC-specific integrations (geometry, energy, cost, materials).
