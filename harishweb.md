# Harish Palani — Vibe Coding

## Who I Am
I’m Harish Palani, an **Architectural Digital Practice Specialist** passionate about bridging design, technology, and creativity.  
My background in architecture (B.Arch, M.Arch) and deep dive into computational design has shaped how I approach the future of building and design workflows.  

## What I Do
- Develop custom tools and plug-ins (Revit, Dynamo, Grasshopper, Rhino.Inside.Revit)  
- Explore **AI-assisted design workflows** — what I call *Vibe Coding*  
- Experiment with simulation engines for **mycelium and algae growth**, **bio-inspired facades**, and **“growing buildings”**  
- Lead workshops and talks that combine **design, computation, and emerging tech**

## Why Vibe Coding
Vibe Coding is my philosophy for working with code as a **dialogue** rather than a rigid process.  
It’s about:
- Coding with intuition and creativity  
- Using AI as a collaborative design partner  
- Exploring *what design could become* when biology, computation, and imagination meet  

## Current Focus
- Building simulation engines in Unreal/Unity for organic architecture  
- Researching algae growth on facades and mycelium-based materials  
- Developing smarter design tools that **learn from designers**  
- Sharing ideas through workshops, conferences, and internal knowledge networks

✨ *Vibe Coding isn’t just about writing code. It’s about **feeling the flow** of design through computation.*
