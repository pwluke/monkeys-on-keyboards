👋 About Me

Hi, I’m Sarah Khadraoui! I’m a textile artist, designer, and technician who also loves exploring the world of code. My creative practice blends craft, technology, and experimentation — and this repository, Coding for Monkeys, is my space for vibe coding: coding without pressure, just curiosity, intuition, and play.

Here you’ll find experiments, happy accidents, and projects built for fun and discovery. It’s a sandbox for learning, breaking, fixing, and vibing with code. 🐒💻✨
