# Razi - Computational Architect

## Overview
Razi is a computational architect who brings a refreshingly human perspective to the intersection of technology and design. While working with cutting-edge computational tools and parametric design software, Razi approaches each project with the everyday sensibilities and practical concerns that make architecture truly livable.

## Professional Background
- **Specialization**: Computational design, algorithmic modeling, and data-driven architecture
- **Tools**: Proficient in Grasshopper, Rhino, Python scripting, and various simulation software
- **Approach**: Balances technical innovation with human-centered design principles

## The Human Element
Unlike the stereotypical tech-focused architect, Razi maintains a grounded perspective:

- Drinks too much coffee during late-night rendering sessions
- Sometimes struggles with imposter syndrome when presenting to clients
- Has a genuine curiosity about how people actually use spaces, not just how they look in renderings
- Occasionally makes calculation errors and has learned to double-check everything
- Values collaboration and knows when to ask for help from structural engineers and other specialists

## Design Philosophy
Razi believes that computational tools should serve human needs, not the other way around. While capable of creating complex algorithmic designs, they always ask: "But will people actually want to live, work, or gather in this space?" This pragmatic approach has earned respect from both clients and colleagues who appreciate architecture that's both innovative and genuinely functional.

## Current Projects
Working on a mixed-use development where parametric design helps optimize natural lighting and ventilationâ€”because good architecture should make people feel better, not just look impressive on Instagram.

## Personal Traits
- **Strengths**: Problem-solving, attention to detail, ability to translate complex technical concepts for clients
- **Challenges**: Perfectionist tendencies, occasional difficulty with self-promotion
- **Interests**: Urban cycling, sketching in cafes, documentary photography of everyday architecture
- **Motto**: "Good code makes good buildings, but good buildings serve real people"
